            Hello, my name is Layla - welcome to my website, hoomans. Let me tell you about myself. I recently moved to Berlin from New Jersey and had to travel by airplane to get here which was super stressful. I barked the whole way here and was
            told you could literally hear me from the cabin! When I arrived, the first thing I did was pee outside Tegel airport on the sidewalk and a maintenance man thought the roof was
            leaking! No regrets.

            Anyway, now that I'm a <strong>true Berliner</strong> - I want to share a few of my favorite things to do here.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Riding the ubahn and S-bahn! Even the ticket inspectors smile at me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Going to restaurants - sometimes I'll get a little treat under the table and usually the waiter brings me water!
                </li>
                <li>
                    My favorite place in the whole world is Tempelhof airport (way better than the first airport).
                </li>
            </ul>
